## Version baseline

Primary development revision: `8bf4605ae81042248add031e94c77300406e0413`. Stable reference: `86cdca76fa2a36274c432caa21952b23c267989a` where applicable.

## Current critical-path result

HM08 is **GRADUATED** at 1000 level. Pinned source establishes watchdog registration/export, ordinary TRAM reset/pet preparation, healthy-read bite detection, `has_bit` plus internal `needs_reset`, user-clear recovery gating, `hm2_force_write()` recovery and the generic `io_error` boundary. Official documentation independently supports the public timeout/`has_bit` model and documents high-impedance I/O behavior after a bite, but physical behavior remains DOC-CONFIRMED rather than cloud-lab TEST-CONFIRMED.

Fixture feasibility review found upstream `hm2_test` is a static register-image registration fixture: reads copy an unchanging pattern and writes are discarded. A meaningful watchdog host-state test needs mutable status injection and write capture; a realistic bite model would additionally simulate FPGA timer behavior. That experiment is promoted to 2000 rather than used to imply hardware evidence. HM08 adversarial reasoning and fresh-AI handoff passed.

IO01 — Encoder path is now the highest-priority unblocked critical-path module and enters RESEARCH.

## Promotion / uncertainty queue

- HAL allocator fragmentation/reuse and unusual cross-process mappings: **2000 / MEDIUM**.
- Recovery after process/thread death with inconsistent HAL recursive-mutex accounting: **2000 / HIGH**.
- Shared pin/signal atomicity and memory-ordering assumptions: **2000 / HIGH**.
- Stable/development ready/unready and object-lifetime comparison: **2000 / MEDIUM**.
- H04 live `addf`/`delf` mutation semantics while realtime dispatch is active: **2000 / HIGH**.
- H04 cross-thread signal visibility/cross-CPU ordering: **2000 / HIGH**.
- Development-only one-shot `initf` versus stable: **2000 / MEDIUM**.
- M03 Task-side command-mutex hold duration and command-to-echo latency distribution: **2000 / HIGH**.
- M03 full planner/kinematics branch trace: **M08/M01/M02 then 2000 / HIGH**.
- HM01 exact IDROM/module descriptor semantics: **HM02 then 2000 / HIGH**.
- HM01 TRAM/register-cycle ordering: **HM03/HM09 / HIGH**.
- HM01 successful fake-board registration fixture extension: **HM02 or 2000 / MEDIUM**.
- E01 production-path stale/duplicate/wrong-size/lost-packet fault injection: **E03/E06 or 2000 / HIGH**.
- E01 exact socket/interface/routing/firewall setup: **E02 / MEDIUM**.
- E01 servo-period Ethernet timing and recovery: **E05/E07 / HIGH**.
- HM08 mutable fake-LLIO production host-state watchdog experiment: **2000 / MEDIUM**; synthetic status/write capture only, never physical evidence.
- HM08 physical watchdog reaction time, actual board pin electrical state, and output-module behavior after bite: **advanced hardware/commissioning / CRITICAL**; requires representative hardware/firmware and safety analysis.
- HM08 transport-specific path that clears/re-establishes communication after `io_error`: **E03/E06/E07 or 2000 / HIGH**.
- EVL/current-master versus pinned hm2_eth behavior: **2000 / HIGH**.
- Physical-machine latency/jitter qualification: **advanced commissioning / CRITICAL**, representative hardware/human involvement required.
- Functional-safety architecture/hazard analysis: **advanced safety / CRITICAL**; LinuxCNC behavior is not safety certification.

## Current checkpoint / exact resume point

Begin **IO01 — Encoder path**. Read its curriculum objective/dependencies, official HostMot2 encoder documentation and experienced-user failure reports, then trace the pinned quadrature-counter/encoder module from module descriptor parsing through exported HAL pins/parameters, TRAM/register reads, count/index handling, scaling and velocity/position publication. Build a function/symbol inventory and end-to-end encoder read call flow before designing a no-hardware experiment. Keep FPGA quadrature capture semantics, host sampling semantics, physical encoder electrical integrity and safety implications distinct. Preserve any press-brake dual-feedback implications only as generic public-course requirements, not machine-specific private design.
